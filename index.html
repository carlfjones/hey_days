        <p class="text" data-aos="fade-right">Hi, welcome to Hey Days furniture!<br><br>
            I’m a London girl who did the big sell up and moved to the seaside in 2014. I fell in love instantly with windy walks on the beach, the ever changing sea and the outdoor life.<br><br>
            
            Having bought a ‘doer upper’ and with very few funds, I learnt a vast range of DIY and handyperson skills very quickly. I sourced second-hand furniture and repaired, renovated and painted it to furnish my home. The results were quirky one-off pieces that brought real character to the rooms and became great talking points when people came to visit.<br><br>
            
            In late 2014, I started working on furniture that friends and family were intending to throw away, and determined not to see good wood go to waste I refurbished and decorated them creating individually designed bespoke pieces for their owners to love again.<br><br>
            
            This ignited a passion to save furniture from being destroyed and turn it instead into something beautiful to be used and adored. I love taking previously tired and unwanted furniture, updating it and seeing it proudly displayed and treasured again in someone’s home.<br><br>
            
            I specialise in creating beautiful, affordable on-off pieces because every room deserves to be made a little special doesn’t it? All my furniture is given the hey-days treatment in my little studio by the sea and sent out into the world via my Etsy shop or locally on Facebook.</p>
